Description: A package for neopeptide prediction from somatic mutation calls of
    cancer genomic sequencing including start-gain, stop-loss, missense and 
    frameshift mutations. This package requires VEP annotated variant call format 
    as input and returns neopeptides for downstream analysis, for example via
    MHC binding prediction with netMHC.
